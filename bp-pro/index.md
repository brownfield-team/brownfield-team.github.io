# BP-Pro (Brownfield Project Dashboard)

BP-Pro provides a portal for instructors and student to integrate 
data from GitHub and Slack, and tools to more effectively adapt
GitHub for a course with software projects.

It helps automate:
* Student signup for a course GitHub organization
* Mapping students from a course roster to Github accounts
* Assignment of students to teams in GitHub
* Creating repositories with the correct team permissions
* Gathering data from GitHub on a per student or per team basis.
