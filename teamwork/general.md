# Tuckman Model: Forming, Norming, Storming, Performing, Adjourning

In 1965, Bruce Tuckman published a paper that has been widely used as a model for what happens when teams form.  The original 1965 paper introduced
  a model with four stages that took on the names Forming, Norming, Storming and Performing.  A fifth stage, Adjourning, was added in later work.

This model can be helpful in giving a name to things that tend to happen, and proposing exercises that can help teams be more successful at each stage.

Practitioners in the agile software community have written articles about applying this model to team formation.
