# Writing Meaningful Commit Messages

Most folks that have worked with `git` and GitHub for any length of time have experienced the phenomenon illustrated in this XKCD comic by Randall Munroe:

It's funny because it's true. 

However, in professional software development practice, it turns out to be important to write meaningful commit messages.  This is especially as code bases get large and live for a long time (in contradistinction to short lived personal projects or assignments).

Many IDEs, as well as the GitHub web interface, have a feature that will annotate each line of source code with the commit that produced it, along with the SHA, the commit message, and *your name* as the developer that made the commit.

It is a matter of professional pride that you'll want your commit messages to be meaningful and useful.
