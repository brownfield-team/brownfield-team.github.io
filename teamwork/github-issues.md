# Using GitHub Issues

Most professional software development teams use some kind of "issue tracking" software.

Examples include:
* Jira
* Trello
* Pivotal Tracker 
* the "Issues" and "Project" features built into GitHub

The idea is that each "bug" or "user story" or "feature request" becomes one "issue" in the issue tracking software.   

These issues can then be prioritized, assigned to team members, and tracked.

For this project, we encourage the use of GitHub Issues for this purpose.   It is available at no cost, and integrated into GitHub. Further, we 
are working towards a brownfield project dashboard that will integrate with GitHub issues and Github Projects, and provide features to support 
the use of these in academic courses that use brownfield assignments.

# Setting up a GitHub organization for your course.

To use GitHub Issues, we strongly encouage you to start by setting up a GitHub organization for your course, and requiring that all of 
the repositories for your course be stored under the GitHub Organization

for your course be 
* Set up an GitHub Organization for your course.
  * If you visit <https://education.github.com/> and click on the "Get Benefits" link, you can register as an educator with Github.
  * There is a one-time verification process that has to be renewed periodicially.
  * Once you are verified, the process of  upgrading Organizations to unlimited private repos at no cost is automated and typically takes
    only seconds.
